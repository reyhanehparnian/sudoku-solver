# Sudoku Solver

This is a simple Python-based Sudoku solver developed as part of my coursework at Bowdoin College.

## 🧠 What It Does

The solver takes a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku board and uses backtracking to fill in the remaining cells, following standard Sudoku rules:

- Each row contains digits 1–9 with no repetition.
- Each column contains digits 1–9 with no repetition.
- Each 3x3 subgrid contains digits 1–9 with no repetition.

## 📁 File

- `sudoku.py` — Main file containing the backtracking Sudoku solver logic.

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then run:

```bash
python3 sudoku.py
